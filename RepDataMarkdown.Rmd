## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## 1. Code for Reading and Checking Data
``` {r read data, echo= TRUE}
data <-read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
str(data)
head(data)
```

## 2. Creating Histogram of Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day
## Calculate Daily Steps by Date
```{r steps by date, echo= TRUE}
dailysteps <- aggregate(steps~date, data, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## Plot Daily Steps via Histogram
```{r histogram, echo= TRUE}
hist(dailysteps$steps, xlab="Total Daily Steps", main= "Histogram of Total Daily Step Count",col=4)
```

## 3. Mean and Median Number of Steps Taken Each Day
```{r mean median, echo=TRUE}
mean(dailysteps$steps)
median(dailysteps$steps)
```
